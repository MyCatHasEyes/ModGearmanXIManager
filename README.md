# ModGearmanXIManager
Nagios XI Component for managing ModGearman installation

# Overview
This is a component used to manage a variety of ModGearman Servers/Workers, possibly running different versions of ModGearman, from a central location - within the Nagios XI interface. ModGearman XI Manager is a fork of an earlier work, ModGearman Manager (https://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Addons/Components/ModGearman-Manager/details).

# How to Use
1. Download the ZIP file
2. Upload it to your Nagios XI instance (Admin -> Manage Components -> Upload)
3. Run the included setup.sh file. This will set up necessary permissions on the workers.
